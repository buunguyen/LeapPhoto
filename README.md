LeapPhoto
=========

Sample app, using [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) to control iPhoto (in fact, any app). Controls:  

* Move finger to move mouse
* Focus at a point to click
* Circle gesture to double-click
* Swipe up/down/left/right to activate corresponding keys

The app will launch iPhoto automatically. That's all. Have fun.
